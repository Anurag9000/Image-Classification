# Data
dataset:
  root_dirs:
    - "d:/Done,Toreview/Image Classification/data/GARBAGE CLASSIFICATION 4.v4"
  batch_size: 32
  num_workers: 4 # Safe to increase now because CPU load is minimal
  val_split: 0.0 

# Training
epochs: 15

# Augmentations (Hyperparams)
# Since data is already heavily augmented offline, we can disable online warping
# The dataset loader will still likely apply basic Flip/Crop if configured, 
# but we don't need to specify heavy params here.
